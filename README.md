# Boris Bikes Week 1 - TDD

Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, has a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

This challenge is comprised of 22 challenges. They all build on one another. They require to research things, to get stuck, to find solutions.
